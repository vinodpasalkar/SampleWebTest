5. Running your first test

To execute a particular test by tag run below command on terminal by going to the project directory

For e.g. In our framework to execute the onlinePurchase , Execute below command

mvn clean verify -Dmetafilter="+onlinePurchase"

Meta filtering the stories/scenario mvn clean verify -Dmetafilter="+SmokeTest" -- This command will run the scenarios with the tag, "SmokeTest" This way we can use this on CI-CD by tagging the test case under the different tags like regression , smoke , sanity etc...
